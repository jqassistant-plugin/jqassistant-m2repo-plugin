It enables jQAssistant to scan and to analyze Maven Repositories.

== Using the jqassistant-m2repo-plugin

NOTE:: Starting from jqassistant-m2repo-plugin v2.0.0, the GraphQL-Plugin resides under jqassistant-plugin.
Therefore, not only the repository location changed but also group id and artifact id were adapted from `com.buschmais.jqassistant.plugin:m2repo` to `org.jqassistant.plugin:jqassistant-m2repo-plugin`.

NOTE:: From jQAssistant v2.0.0 onwards, it is not part of the core distribution anymore and a manual configuration as shown below is required.
